<p><code<whoami</code> I am currently prepping for the OSCP exam.</p>

<p>Here on my profile I am sharing some walk-throughs of HackTheBox, TryHackme, Vulnhub, Overthewire and other plattforms I find interesting to help myself creating reports, deepen the techniques I learned, and also to help you if you got stuck on some room or exercise.</p>

On TryHackMe I am in the top 50 of my country's best and in the top 1% worldwide!
