<p>I am a Cyber Security student, currently prepping for the eJPT exam which after I'll study for the OSCP.</p>

<p>Here on my profile I am sharing some walk-throughs of HackTheBox, TryHackme, Vulnhub, Overthewire and other plattforms I find interesting to help myself creating reports, deepen the techniques I learned, and also to help you if you got stuck on some room or exercise.</p>

<p>From the moment of starting out in Cyber Security I am focused on Penetration testing, Red Teaming and my profile, tools and methodology I use will reflect that. So stick around if you're on the same path as I post regularly! Feel free to ping me to keep in touch!</p>
